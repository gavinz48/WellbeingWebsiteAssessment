				<h2>Student Wellbeing</h2> 
				<p>Onslow College is committed to providing a safe environment for all students. Our pastoral care network includes AkoTeachers, Deans, Guidance Counsellors, Deputy Principals and the Principal.</p>

				<h2>Harassment and Bullying</h2>
				<p>Onslow College takes bullying very seriously and has put structures in place to combat and cope with it, should it occur.</p>
				<h3><strong>What is harassment/bullying?</strong></h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Name calling; whether it is sexually, racially or physically based.</li>
					<li>Social exclusion/leaving a person out of a group deliberately.</li>
					<li>Demanding or borrowing, without permission, stationery, gear, money etc.</li>
					<li>Physical pushing, shoving etc.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3><strong>What do I do if I get harassed/bullied OR see someone else being hassled?</strong></h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Talk to a Peer Supporter (for Year 9 students).</li>
					<li>Talk to your Ako Teacher.</li>
					<li>Discuss it with the Dean.</li>
					<li>Discuss it with a Guidance Counsellor <strong>CONFIDENTIALLY.</strong></li>
					<li>Email: <a href="mailto:endbullying@onslow.school.nz">endbullying@onslow.school.nz</a></li><!--Email to endbullying@onslow redirect-->
				</ul>
				<h3><strong>What happens when I tell someone?</strong></h3>
				<p>This is often up to you, it depends on the situation.</p>
				<ul>	
					<li>It can be kept confidential to avoid you being labelled a “nark”.</li>
					<li>You can ask for a Peer Mediation – This is where senior students work through a mediation/talking through process to resolve the issue.</li>
					<li>Discipline – This varies according to each situation. The student doing the bullying could be withdrawn from class, stood down from school, OR any other appropriate punishment.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3><strong>Remember:</strong></h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>HARASSMENT/BULLYING</strong> is <strong>NEVER</strong> okay.</li>
					<li><strong>TELLING</strong> someone about it is!</li>
					<li>Email: <a href="mailto:endbullying@onslow.school.nz">endbullying@onslow.school.nz</a></li>

				<h2>Ako Time</h2>
				<p>The aim of Ako time is to develop well-informed students with the tools and support to direct their own learning and future pathways. It also helps students develop connections with one another, staff, the school and the community. Students also spend time developing their understanding of environmental and social issues and how they can contribute solutions to these areas.</p>
